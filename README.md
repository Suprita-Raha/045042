**PROJECT 1: Creating Dynamic Plots**

**Objective:**
This project aims to provide dynamic and interactive visualizations of the data using various chart types to analyze and explore patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. 
The visualizations are created using the Plotly library in Python, showcasing different aspects of the data over time, across regions, countries, and product categories.

**Dataset:**
The project utilizes a finance dataset ("Python Dynamic DataSet.xlsx") containing information such as region, country, sales representatives, gender, age, rank, products, years, quarter, month, and revenue in USD. 
The dataset is read into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis and visualization.
