**PROJECT 1: Creating Dynamic Plots**

**Objective:**
This project aims to provide dynamic and interactive visualizations of the data using various chart types to analyze and explore patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. 
The visualizations are created using the Plotly library in Python, showcasing different aspects of the data over time, across regions, countries, and product categories.

**Dataset:**
The project utilizes a finance dataset ("Python Dynamic DataSet.xlsx") containing information such as region, country, sales representatives, gender, age, rank, products, years, quarter, month, and revenue in USD. 
The dataset is read into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis and visualization.

**Visualizations:**

Moving Bubble Chart - Revenue Over Months Rankwise:

Displays the dynamic trend of revenue over months based on rank, with bubbles representing different regions.
Moving Bar Chart - Revenue Generated by Country Over Quarter:

Illustrates the quarterly revenue generated by different countries through a dynamic bar chart.
Dynamic Box Plot - Products Preference as per Different Gender Groups:

Shows the distribution of revenue across different products for various gender groups over months.
Moving Bubble Chart - Revenue generated by Products over Countries:

Visualizes the dynamic relationship between revenue, products, and countries over different months.
Moving Bubble Chart - Revenue across Age and Products:

Highlights the correlation between revenue, age, and products in a dynamic bubble chart over months.
